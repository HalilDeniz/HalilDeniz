# Hello, I'm Halil Ibrahim Deniz!

## üí´ About Me

Hello, I'm Halil Ibrahim. At the age of 23 and with a high school diploma in hand, I've nurtured an immense passion for the dynamic worlds of cybersecurity and programming. My journey has led me to delve deep into programming languages like Python, Java, and Rust, each of which I've applied in real-world scenarios. I've had the privilege of using these skills to assist a prominent website dedicated exclusively to cybersecurity, enhancing its infrastructure and fortifying its defenses. I also share my evolving knowledge and experiences through in-depth articles on my blog each week. To further serve the programming community, I release an open-source project on my GitHub account on a weekly basis. Continuous learning is at the heart of my ethos; alongside refining my technical expertise, I'm earnestly working to elevate my command over English and to embrace the challenges of learning German.

## Skills

### Cybersecurity

#### Network Security

- Network security is one of the most important topics in cybersecurity. I'm trying to specialize in network security to keep my network safe.
- My network security skills include fundamental topics such as secure encryption protocols, secure network configuration, and firewalls. I can also perform network security tests using different tools like network scanners, port scanning tools, and network analysis tools.

#### Cybersecurity Tools

- I'm constantly trying to improve myself by using different tools used in cybersecurity. These tools include various tools such as Nmap, Metasploit Framework, Wireshark, and Kali Linux.
- By simulating different cyber attack scenarios using these tools, I can test defense mechanisms and improve network security.

### Programming

#### Python Programming

- Python is one of the programming languages I know the best. I'm highly skilled in software development using this language and have developed solutions for many different projects using Python.
- My Python skills include different topics such as data structures, functions, object-oriented programming, GUI programming, and web development. I also work on different areas such as artificial intelligence, data science, and machine learning using Python.

#### C++ Programming

- C++ is one of my favorite programming languages for software development. Since I started developing software in this language, I'm constantly trying to improve my C++ skills.
- My C++ skills include fundamental topics such as data structures, algorithms, memory management, and object-oriented programming. I also work on different areas such as game development using C++.

### Hardware

#### Microcontroller Programming

- Microcontroller programming is one of my favorite areas of expertise in hardware. In this area, I mainly work on platforms such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi.

## Interests

- Learning foreign languages: Learning languages is an important hobby for me. Currently, I'm improving my English and learning German. I also plan to learn other languages in the future.
- Knowledge Sharing: I always like to share the information I learn on my website called [DenizHali](https://denizhalil.com) with people in the most descriptive way.
